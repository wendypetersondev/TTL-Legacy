# TTL-Legacy — Micro-Endowment Check-In Vault on Stellar

[![CI](https://github.com/OxDev-max/TTL-Legacy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OxDev-max/TTL-Legacy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A decentralized "Dead Man's Switch" built on Stellar/Soroban smart contracts.

TTL-Legacy is a time-capsule vault where funds (XLM or tokenized assets) are released to a beneficiary only if the owner fails to "check in" via a Passkey-powered interface. It leverages Soroban's State Archival and TTL (Time to Live) features to automate asset inheritance — no seed phrase complexity required.

## 🎯 What is TTL-Legacy?

TTL-Legacy turns Stellar's native state archival mechanics into a programmable inheritance trigger. Vault owners:

- Deposit funds into a personal vault contract
- Periodically "check in" to extend the contract's TTL and prove liveness
- Designate a beneficiary address for automatic release
- Authenticate exclusively via Passkeys (WebAuthn) — no seed phrases

If the owner stops checking in, the contract's TTL expires and the vault automatically releases funds to the beneficiary.

This Soroban implementation makes TTL-Legacy:

✅ Trustless (no executor, lawyer, or coordinator needed)  
✅ Transparent (all vault state and transfers are on-chain)  
✅ Secure (Passkey/WebAuthn authentication, no exposed seed phrases)  
✅ Automated (TTL expiry triggers transfer without manual intervention)

## 🚀 Features

- **Create a Vault**: Set a beneficiary address and check-in interval
- **Check-In**: Extend the contract TTL to reset the countdown
- **Automatic Release**: Funds transfer to beneficiary when TTL lapses
- **Passkey Auth**: WebAuthn-based authentication for all owner actions
- **Reminder System**: Backend sends encrypted email/SMS check-in reminders
- **Legacy Dashboard**: Minimalist frontend to manage vault state and history
- **Native XLM Support**: Built-in support for Stellar Lumens
- **Token Ready**: Architecture supports custom Stellar tokens (roadmap item)

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (1.70+)
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar CLI

### Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Test

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Setup Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
# Network configuration
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Contract addresses (after deployment)
CONTRACT_TTL_VAULT=<your-contract-id>

# Frontend configuration
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Backend (reminder service)
REMINDER_EMAIL_API_KEY=<your-key>
REMINDER_SMS_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

Network configurations are defined in `environments.toml`:

- `testnet` — Stellar testnet
- `mainnet` — Stellar mainnet
- `futurenet` — Stellar futurenet
- `standalone` — Local development

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Configure your testnet identity first
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

### Deploy to Mainnet

Required environment variables before running:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `STELLAR_MAINNET_RPC_URL` | Mainnet RPC endpoint (e.g. `https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com`) |
| `DEPLOYER_IDENTITY` | Stellar CLI key name to sign the deployment (default: `deployer-mainnet`) |

```bash
# Configure your mainnet identity first
stellar keys generate deployer-mainnet --network mainnet

# Set required env var
export STELLAR_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com

# Deploy (will prompt for confirmation)
./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh
```

The script will display the target network and identity, then require you to type `mainnet` before proceeding.

## 🎓 Smart Contract API

### Vault Management

```rust
create_vault(beneficiary: Address, check_in_interval: u64) -> u64
get_vault(vault_id: u64) -> Vault
get_ttl_remaining(vault_id: u64) -> Option<u64>
```

### Owner Actions

```rust
check_in(vault_id: u64)
deposit(vault_id: u64, amount: i128)
withdraw(vault_id: u64, amount: i128)
update_beneficiary(vault_id: u64, new_beneficiary: Address)
```

### Release

```rust
trigger_release(vault_id: u64)
is_expired(vault_id: u64) -> bool
get_release_status(vault_id: u64) -> ReleaseStatus
```

### Hibernation

```rust
enter_hibernation(vault_id: u64, caller: Address, duration_seconds: u64)
exit_hibernation(vault_id: u64, caller: Address)
get_hibernation(vault_id: u64) -> Option<HibernationEntry>
```

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

✅ Vault creation and configuration  
✅ Check-in flow and TTL extension  
✅ TTL expiry and automatic release  
✅ Passkey authentication validation  
✅ Beneficiary payout execution  
✅ Error handling and edge cases  

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**The Problem**: Over $140 billion in crypto assets are estimated to be permanently lost due to inaccessible wallets. Traditional inheritance mechanisms don't map to self-custodied digital assets.

**Blockchain Benefits**:

- No trusted executor or legal intermediary required
- Transparent vault state and release history on-chain
- Programmable rules enforced by smart contracts
- Passkey auth removes the seed phrase single point of failure

**Target Users**:

- Long-term crypto holders planning for asset continuity
- Individuals without access to traditional estate planning
- Families and communities building generational wealth on-chain
- Anyone who wants a secure, automated digital legacy plan

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **v1.0 (Current)**: XLM vaults, TTL-based release, Passkey auth
- **v1.1**: Custom token support (USDC, EURC, etc.)
- **v2.0**: Multi-beneficiary splits, conditional release logic
- **v3.0**: Mobile-friendly frontend, push notification reminders
- **v4.0**: Fiat on/off-ramps, legal document anchoring via Stellar
