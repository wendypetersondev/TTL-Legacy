# Token Management Features

This document describes the token management features implemented in TTL-Legacy, including token conversion, staking, yield distribution, lending, collateral, hedging, and rebalancing.

## Overview

TTL-Legacy now supports advanced token management capabilities that allow vault owners to:

1. **Convert tokens** before release (Issue #581)
2. **Validate token whitelisting** in batch operations (Issue #582)
3. **Stake tokens** for yield while locked (Issue #583)
4. **Distribute or reinvest yield** (Issue #584)
5. **Lend vault tokens** for interest income (Issue #585)
6. **Use tokens as collateral** for loans (Issue #586)
7. **Hedge token price risk** using derivatives (Issue #587)
8. **Rebalance multi-token portfolios** based on target weights (Issue #588)

## Fee Calculation

This section explains how various fees are calculated in TTL-Legacy token management operations, enabling users to predict transaction costs and understand fee distribution.

### Swap Fees

Swap fees are charged when converting one token to another.

**Formula:**
```
swap_fee = (amount * swap_fee_bps) / 10000
amount_after_fee = amount - swap_fee
```

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: Total input token amount
- `swap_fee_bps`: Basis points charged by the protocol (default: 30 bps = 0.3%)
- `amount_after_fee`: Actual amount used for conversion

**Example:**
```
Input amount: 1,000 USDC
Swap fee rate: 30 bps (0.3%)
Swap fee = (1,000 * 30) / 10000 = 3 USDC
Amount converted = 1,000 - 3 = 997 USDC
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 70% goes to protocol treasury (2.1 USDC)
- 30% goes to the vault as a rebate (0.9 USDC)

### Conversion Fees

Conversion fees apply when transferring between different token types during withdrawal or release.

**Formula:**
```
conversion_fee = (amount * conversion_fee_bps) / 10000
amount_received = amount - conversion_fee
```

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: Total token amount to convert
- `conversion_fee_bps`: Basis points charged (default: 15 bps = 0.15%)
- `from_token`: Source token
- `to_token`: Destination token

**Example:**
```
Original vault amount: 500 XLM
Converting to USDC
Conversion fee rate: 15 bps (0.15%)
Conversion fee = (500 * 15) / 10000 = 0.75 XLM
Amount after fee = 500 - 0.75 = 499.25 XLM (converted)
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 60% goes to protocol treasury (0.45 XLM)
- 40% goes to the originating token pool (0.30 XLM)

### Staking Fees

Staking fees are charged when enabling or managing staked positions.

**Formula:**
```
entry_fee = (amount * staking_entry_fee_bps) / 10000
management_fee = (staked_amount * annual_management_fee_bps / 365) / 10000
```

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: Amount being staked
- `staking_entry_fee_bps`: Entry fee in basis points (default: 25 bps = 0.25%)
- `annual_management_fee_bps`: Annual management fee (default: 50 bps = 0.5% per year)

**Example:**
```
Staking 10,000 XLM

Entry fee = (10,000 * 25) / 10000 = 2.5 XLM
Amount staked = 10,000 - 2.5 = 9,997.5 XLM

Daily management fee = (9,997.5 * 50 / 365) / 10000 = 0.137 XLM/day
Annual management fee = 50 XLM (approximately)
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- Entry fee: 100% to protocol treasury
- Management fee: 80% to protocol, 20% to vault operator

### Yield Distribution Fees

When yield is distributed or reinvested, fees may apply based on the distribution method.

**Formula:**
```
yield_accrued = (staked_amount * annual_yield_bps * days_elapsed) / (10000 * 365)
distribution_fee = (yield_accrued * yield_fee_bps) / 10000
yield_after_fee = yield_accrued - distribution_fee
```

**Parameters:**
- `annual_yield_bps`: Annual yield rate (varies by staking pool, e.g., 500 bps = 5% APY)
- `days_elapsed`: Number of days since staking or last distribution
- `yield_fee_bps`: Fee on distributed yield (default: 10 bps = 0.1%)

**Example:**
```
Staked amount: 10,000 XLM at 5% APY
Days elapsed: 365 (1 year)

Yield accrued = (10,000 * 500 * 365) / (10000 * 365) = 500 XLM
Yield fee = (500 * 10) / 10000 = 0.5 XLM
Yield distributed = 500 - 0.5 = 499.5 XLM

Options:
1. Distribute to beneficiary: 499.5 XLM sent
2. Reinvest: 499.5 XLM added to staked amount
3. Split (70/30): 349.65 XLM to beneficiary, 149.85 XLM reinvested
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 100% of yield fees go to protocol treasury

### Lending Fees

Lending fees include entry fees and origination fees charged by the protocol.

**Formula:**
```
entry_fee = (loan_amount * lending_entry_fee_bps) / 10000
origination_fee = (loan_amount * origination_fee_bps) / 10000
total_fees = entry_fee + origination_fee
net_loan_amount = loan_amount - total_fees
```

**Parameters:**
- `loan_amount`: Amount being lent out
- `lending_entry_fee_bps`: Entry fee (default: 50 bps = 0.5%)
- `origination_fee_bps`: Origination fee (default: 25 bps = 0.25%)
- `interest_rate_bps`: Annual interest rate (e.g., 500 bps = 5%)

**Example:**
```
Lending 5,000 XLM at 5% annual interest for 180 days

Entry fee = (5,000 * 50) / 10000 = 2.5 XLM
Origination fee = (5,000 * 25) / 10000 = 1.25 XLM
Total fees = 3.75 XLM
Net loan to borrower = 5,000 - 3.75 = 4,996.25 XLM

Interest accrued = (5,000 * 500 * 180) / (10000 * 365) = 123.29 XLM
Total received after loan term = 5,000 + 123.29 = 5,123.29 XLM
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- Entry fee: 100% to protocol treasury
- Origination fee: 100% to protocol treasury
- Interest: 100% to vault owner

### Collateral Fees

Collateral fees apply when using vault tokens as collateral for external loans.

**Formula:**
```
collateral_fee = (collateral_amount * collateral_fee_bps) / 10000
```

**Parameters:**
- `collateral_amount`: Amount used as collateral
- `collateral_fee_bps`: Annual collateral management fee (default: 30 bps = 0.3%)

**Example:**
```
Using 2,000 XLM as collateral for a loan

Annual collateral fee = (2,000 * 30) / 10000 = 0.6 XLM per year
Monthly fee = 0.6 / 12 = 0.05 XLM per month
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 100% to protocol treasury

### Hedging Fees

Hedging fees cover the cost of maintaining derivative positions.

**Formula:**
```
hedge_fee = (notional_amount * annual_hedge_fee_bps * days_active) / (10000 * 365)
```

**Parameters:**
- `notional_amount`: Notional value of the hedge
- `annual_hedge_fee_bps`: Annual fee rate (default: 100 bps = 1%)
- `days_active`: Number of days the hedge has been active

**Example:**
```
Hedging 1,000 XLM (notional: $200 at $0.20/XLM) for 90 days
Annual hedge fee rate: 1% (100 bps)

Hedge fee = (1,000 * 100 * 90) / (10000 * 365) = 2.47 XLM
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 80% to protocol treasury (1.98 XLM)
- 20% to hedge provider/liquidity pool (0.49 XLM)

### Rebalancing Fees

Rebalancing fees apply when the portfolio is rebalanced to target weights.

**Formula:**
```
rebalance_fee = (total_portfolio_value * rebalance_fee_bps) / 10000
```

**Parameters:**
- `total_portfolio_value`: Sum of all token values in the vault
- `rebalance_fee_bps`: Fee per rebalance event (default: 40 bps = 0.4%)

**Example:**
```
Portfolio value: 
- 1,000 XLM ($200)
- 1,000 USDC ($1,000)
- Total: $1,200

Rebalancing fee = ($1,200 * 40) / 10000 = $4.80 (or ~24 XLM)
```

**Fee Distribution:**
- 100% to protocol treasury

### Fee Summary Table

| Operation | Typical Fee | Distribution | Notes |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Swap | 30 bps | 70% treasury, 30% vault | Applied on conversion amount |
| Conversion | 15 bps | 60% treasury, 40% pool | Applied on output amount |
| Staking Entry | 25 bps | 100% treasury | One-time at staking start |
| Staking Management | 50 bps/year | 80% treasury, 20% operator | Daily deduction |
| Yield Distribution | 10 bps | 100% treasury | Applied to yield only |
| Lending Entry | 50 bps | 100% treasury | One-time upfront |
| Lending Origination | 25 bps | 100% treasury | One-time upfront |
| Collateral | 30 bps/year | 100% treasury | Monthly deduction |
| Hedging | 100 bps/year | 80% treasury, 20% provider | Daily deduction |
| Rebalancing | 40 bps | 100% treasury | Per rebalance event |

### Gas Fee Considerations

Smart contract operations incur Stellar network fees in addition to TTL-Legacy fees.

**Typical Gas Costs (XLM):**
- Simple transfer: 0.00001 XLM (1 stroops)
- Token contract interaction: 0.0001 - 0.001 XLM (10-100 stroops)
- Complex multi-step operation: 0.001 - 0.01 XLM (100-1000 stroops)

**Total Cost Example:**
```
Staking 10,000 XLM:
1. Staking entry fee: 2.5 XLM
2. Network gas: ~0.0005 XLM
3. Total: ~2.5005 XLM

Effective cost: 0.025005% (minimal additional impact)
```

### Fee Adjustment Strategy

Protocol fees may be adjusted by governance. Upcoming changes include:

- Dynamic fees based on network congestion
- Tiered fees for high-volume users
- Loyalty discounts for long-term vault holders
- Fee reductions during low-activity periods

## Issue #581: Token Conversion

### Purpose

Allow vault owners to convert their vault tokens to different tokens before the vault is released to the beneficiary. This is useful for:

- Converting to stablecoins before release
- Exchanging to preferred tokens
- Hedging against price volatility

### API

#### Enable Token Conversion

```rust
pub fn enable_token_conversion(
    env: Env,
    vault_id: u64,
    from_token: Address,
    to_token: Address,
    conversion_rate: i128,
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: The vault ID
- `from_token`: Source token address (must be whitelisted)
- `to_token`: Target token address (must be whitelisted)
- `conversion_rate`: Conversion rate in basis points (10000 = 1:1)

**Requirements:**
- Caller must be the vault owner
- Both tokens must be whitelisted
- Conversion rate must be positive

**Events:**
- `TOKEN_CONVERSION_TOPIC`: Emitted when conversion is enabled

#### Get Token Conversion

```rust
pub fn get_token_conversion(env: Env, vault_id: u64) -> Option<TokenConversion>
```

Returns the token conversion configuration for a vault, or `None` if not configured.

### Example Usage

```rust
// Enable conversion from XLM to USDC at 1:1 rate
client.enable_token_conversion(
    &vault_id,
    &xlm_token,
    &usdc_token,
    &10000i128, // 1:1 rate
);

// Retrieve conversion config
if let Some(conversion) = client.get_token_conversion(&vault_id) {
    println!("Converting {} to {} at rate {}", 
        conversion.from_token, 
        conversion.to_token, 
        conversion.conversion_rate);
}
```

## Wrapped Token Support for Cross-Chain Compatibility

### Purpose

Allow vault owners to use wrapped tokens that represent a canonical token from another chain or bridge.
Wrapped tokens are accepted whenever their registered canonical token is whitelisted.

### API

#### Register Wrapped Token

```rust
pub fn register_wrapped_token(
    env: Env,
    wrapped_token_address: Address,
    canonical_token_address: Address,
)
```

### Example Usage

```rust
client.register_wrapped_token(&wrapped_token, &xlm_token);
```

Wrapped token registration makes it possible to create vaults and deposit with the wrapped asset while still enforcing the canonical token whitelist.

## Issue #582: Token Whitelisting Validation

### Purpose

Ensure that only whitelisted tokens can be deposited into vaults through batch operations. This prevents accidental or malicious use of non-approved tokens.

### Implementation

The `batch_deposit` function now validates that each vault's token is whitelisted before processing deposits:

```rust
pub fn batch_deposit(env: Env, from: Address, deposits: Vec<(u64, i128)>) {
    // ... validation ...
    
    // Issue #582: Validate token whitelist
    Self::assert_token_whitelisted(&env, &vault.token_address);
    
    // ... process deposit ...
    
    // Emit token whitelist validation event
    env.events().publish(
        (TOKEN_WHITELIST_VALIDATED_TOPIC, vault_id),
        (&vault.token_address, amount),
    );
}
```

### Validation Rules

1. Default XLM token is always whitelisted
2. Custom tokens must be explicitly whitelisted by admin
3. Validation occurs for each vault in the batch before any transfers
4. If any vault uses a non-whitelisted token, the entire batch is rejected

### Events

- `TOKEN_WHITELIST_VALIDATED_TOPIC`: Emitted for each successfully validated deposit

## Issue #583: Token Staking

### Purpose

Allow vault owners to stake their vault tokens in external staking pools to earn yield while the vault is locked. This enables passive income generation during the vault's active period.

### API

#### Enable Token Staking

```rust
pub fn enable_token_staking(
    env: Env,
    vault_id: u64,
    staking_pool: Address,
    annual_yield_bps: u32,
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: The vault ID
- `staking_pool`: Address of the staking pool contract
- `annual_yield_bps`: Annual yield in basis points (e.g., 500 = 5%)

**Requirements:**
- Caller must be the vault owner
- Annual yield must be between 0 and 10000 basis points

**Events:**
- `TOKEN_STAKING_TOPIC`: Emitted when staking is enabled

#### Disable Token Staking

```rust
pub fn disable_token_staking(env: Env, vault_id: u64)
```

Disables staking for a vault. The vault owner can call this to stop earning yield.

**Events:**
- `TOKEN_UNSTAKING_TOPIC`: Emitted when staking is disabled

#### Get Token Staking

```rust
pub fn get_token_staking(env: Env, vault_id: u64) -> Option<TokenStaking>
```

Returns the staking configuration for a vault.

### Example Usage

```rust
// Enable staking with 5% annual yield
client.enable_token_staking(
    &vault_id,
    &staking_pool_address,
    &500u32, // 5% APY
);

// Check staking status
if let Some(staking) = client.get_token_staking(&vault_id) {
    println!("Staking {} tokens at {}% APY",
        staking.staked_amount,
        staking.annual_yield_bps as f64 / 100.0);
}

// Disable staking
client.disable_token_staking(&vault_id);
```

## Issue #584: Token Yield Distribution

### Purpose

Configure how staking yield is distributed or reinvested. Vault owners can choose to:

1. **Distribute to Beneficiary**: Send all yield to the beneficiary
2. **Reinvest**: Automatically reinvest yield back into the vault
3. **Split**: Distribute a percentage to beneficiary and reinvest the rest

### API

#### Set Yield Distribution

```rust
pub fn set_yield_distribution(
    env: Env,
    vault_id: u64,
    mode: YieldDistributionMode,
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `vault_id`: The vault ID
- `mode`: The distribution mode (see below)

**Yield Distribution Modes:**

```rust
pub enum YieldDistributionMode {
    /// Distribute all yield to beneficiary
    DistributeToBeneficiary,
    
    /// Reinvest all yield back into vault
    Reinvest,
    
    /// Split yield: beneficiary_bps to beneficiary, rest reinvested
    Split(u32), // basis points for beneficiary
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Caller must be the vault owner
- Vault must have staking enabled

**Events:**
- `YIELD_DISTRIBUTED_TOPIC`: Emitted when yield is distributed

#### Get Yield Distribution

```rust
pub fn get_yield_distribution(env: Env, vault_id: u64) -> Option<YieldDistributionConfig>
```

Returns the yield distribution configuration for a vault.

#### Distribute Yield

```rust
pub fn distribute_yield(env: Env, vault_id: u64)
```

Calculates accumulated yield and distributes it according to the configured mode.

**Yield Calculation:**

```
yield = (staked_amount × annual_yield_bps × time_elapsed) / (10000 × 365 × 86400)
```

**Events:**
- `YIELD_DISTRIBUTED_TOPIC`: Emitted when yield is sent to beneficiary
- `YIELD_REINVESTED_TOPIC`: Emitted when yield is reinvested

### Example Usage

```rust
// Distribute all yield to beneficiary
client.set_yield_distribution(
    &vault_id,
    &YieldDistributionMode::DistributeToBeneficiary,
);

// Or reinvest all yield
client.set_yield_distribution(
    &vault_id,
    &YieldDistributionMode::Reinvest,
);

// Or split 70% to beneficiary, 30% reinvest
client.set_yield_distribution(
    &vault_id,
    &YieldDistributionMode::Split(7000u32),
);

// Distribute accumulated yield
client.distribute_yield(&vault_id);

// Check distribution stats
if let Some(config) = client.get_yield_distribution(&vault_id) {
    println!("Total distributed: {}", config.total_distributed);
    println!("Total reinvested: {}", config.total_reinvested);
}
```

## Integration Example

Here's a complete example showing how to use all token management features together:

```rust
// 1. Create a vault
let vault_id = client.create_vault(&owner, &beneficiary, &86400u64, &None);

// 2. Deposit funds
client.deposit(&vault_id, &owner, &1_000_000i128);

// 3. Enable staking with 5% APY
client.enable_token_staking(&vault_id, &staking_pool, &500u32);

// 4. Set yield distribution (70% to beneficiary, 30% reinvest)
client.set_yield_distribution(
    &vault_id,
    &YieldDistributionMode::Split(7000u32),
);

// 5. Enable token conversion (optional)
client.enable_token_conversion(
    &vault_id,
    &xlm_token,
    &usdc_token,
    &10000i128,
);

// 6. After some time, distribute yield
client.distribute_yield(&vault_id);

// 7. Check final state
let config = client.get_yield_distribution(&vault_id).unwrap();
println!("Distributed to beneficiary: {}", config.total_distributed);
println!("Reinvested: {}", config.total_reinvested);
```

pub fn get_token_rebalance(env: Env, vault_id: u64) -> Option<TokenRebalanceConfig>
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Whitelisting**: Only whitelisted tokens can be used in vaults
2. **Owner Authorization**: Only vault owners can configure staking, lending, collateral, hedging, and rebalancing
3. **Yield Calculation**: Yield is calculated based on time elapsed and annual rate
4. **Atomic Operations**: Batch deposits validate all items before any transfers
5. **Event Tracking**: All operations emit events for on-chain audit trails
6. **Collateral Ratio**: Collateral ratio must be ≥ 100% to prevent under-collateralised loans
7. **Balance Checks**: Lending and collateral operations verify sufficient vault balance
