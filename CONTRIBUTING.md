## Pull Requests

**Before submitting:**

- Lint: `cargo clippy --package ttl-vault -- -D warnings`
- Audit: `cargo audit`

## Security Audit Process

We use `cargo audit` to automatically detect and report security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Running Audit Locally

```bash
# Install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-audit

# Run audit (fails on CRITICAL or HIGH severity)
cargo audit --deny warnings
```

### Audit Configuration

The audit configuration is managed in `.cargo/audit.toml`:

```toml
# Denies CI build on these severity levels
deny = ["unmaintained", "unsound"]

# Advisory allowlist with justifications
[advisories]
# "ADVISORY_ID" = { reason = "Justification" }
```

### Handling Vulnerabilities

1. **Immediate Patch**: If a CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerability is found, update the dependency immediately
2. **Minor Patch**: For MEDIUM vulnerabilities, plan an update in the next release cycle
3. **Accepted Advisories**: If a vulnerability cannot be fixed immediately, document the acceptance in `.cargo/audit.toml` with a clear justification

Example accepted advisory:

```toml
[advisories]
"RUSTSEC-2021-0001" = { reason = "Affects unused feature X; scheduled for removal in v2.0" }
```

### CI Integration

The CI pipeline runs `cargo audit` on every PR. Builds will fail if:
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities are detected
- Accepted advisories lack proper justification

### Secret Scanning

We use Gitleaks in CI to prevent secrets from being committed in repository files or PR diffs.

- The workflow scans the repository on every push and pull request.
- Pull requests are scanned against the configured Gitleaks ruleset in `.gitleaks.toml`.
- Local developers can run the same check before pushing:

```bash
# Install gitleaks if needed
brew install gitleaks
# or: go install github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/v8@latest

# Scan the repository
gitleaks detect --source . --config .gitleaks.toml --redact
```

If a false positive is encountered, add a narrow allowlist entry to `.gitleaks.toml` with a clear justification.
